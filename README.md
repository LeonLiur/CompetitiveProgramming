# CompProgramming
Repository for competitive programming preparation, 2020 - 2023. Includes a large variety (200+) of problems that I solved on dmoj.ca ([my profile](https://dmoj.ca/user/LeonLiur)). Most of them are CCC (Canadian Computing Competition) problems, but also a large amount are practice problems from DMOPC (DMOJ-hosted contests) and older contests to practice. 

Learning about algorithms was not the most fun experience, but I did learn the **valuable lesson** that ***algorithms do not get you contest success, a problem-solving mindset does***. 

That being said, I will never forget Prim's algorithm.
